## Consolidation challenge
In this exercise we (see below) are learning the agile philosophy through the Scrum methodology. We have invented a new company that translates lyrics from one language to another using two APIs:
* Chartlyrics to get the lyrics of the songs
* Yandex to actually translate the songs

## Objectives
* Learn to work in group with the Agile approach
* Learn the value of stand up meetings and SCRUM
* Use some AB testing
* use google analytics
